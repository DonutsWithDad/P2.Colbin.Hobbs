# Eye Tracking Technology
  The eye tracking technology will work similar to that of cardboard VR headsets
  When you look at something for long enough, a loading option will appear and once it completes the selected button will be activated
# Night Mode
  There will be a native night mode that contains a simplified version of the menu, probably containing just the time / date and the music player
  This menu will also be fully cusomizable so that the user can add whatever widgets they would like to to the menu
# General Options
  All general options will be available through a propritary application. This would have full control of the settings for the mirror and allow the user to customize the mirror
  This is done so that way the user can interact with a menu that is more familiar to them (apple or android settings app) and not have to mess with the touch screen interface of the mirror. (Kind of like the apple watch, where some settings are only accessed through the iphone apple watch app)
  See the second drawn sketch for a full list of options for this application
# Phone apps
  Tracking apps will take up the native interface of the phone that is connected to it. So if you use an iPhone, the iPhone health app will show. The music apps will be the music service that is connected to it. The news apps will be the chosen app from the phone settings app. The messages will take up the interface of whatever platform that is connected to it. So iMessage will show for iPhones. This settings can also be turned off in the settings phone settings app to use propritary tracking services for health and other options.
# Some more notes
  I have included photoshop files of the final product as well as some jpgs of the final product with some open menus. This is to give a better idea of what the project is going to look like.
